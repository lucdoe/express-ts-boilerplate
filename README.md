# Express-TS-Boilerplate

A opinionated boilerplate structure for a scalable Express.js backend with TypeScript and JS Standard Linter for building Microservices/ APIs.

## Features

- Express.js framework
- TypeScript integration
- StandardJS Linter
- Middleware packages: compression, cors, helmet, express-validator
- Logging with Winston
- Docker and Docker Compose support

## Requirements

- Node.js v14.x.x or higher
- Docker (optional for containerization)

## Available Scripts

- `npm run lint`: Lint and fix TypeScript files with StandardJS.
- `npm start`: Start the production server.
- `npm run predev`: Lint, fix, and compile TypeScript files.
- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with hot-reloading.
- `npm run build:docker`: Build the Docker image for the application.
- `npm run run:docker`: Run the application using the Docker container.
- `npm run compose:docker`: Start the application and related services using Docker Compose.
- `npm run down:docker`: Stop and remove the application and related services using Docker Compose.
- `npm run stop:docker`: Stop the Docker container.
- `npm run remove:docker`: Remove the Docker container.

## Going to Production with [Your Project Name]

This Express.js Boilerplate Application is designed to help you get started quickly and efficiently. However, when transitioning to a production environment, there are several considerations to ensure your application is secure, stable, and performant. Please follow these best practices before deploying your application to production:

### 1. Security
- **Use HTTPS**: Secure your application by enabling HTTPS. This encrypts data between the client and server, ensuring sensitive information is transmitted securely.
- **Update Dependencies**: Regularly check for and update dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Enable Security Headers**: Use the [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) package to enable various security headers that help protect your application from common attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a secure authentication and authorization system to manage user access and privileges.

### 2. Performance
- **Use Compression**: Enable compression with [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) middleware to reduce the size of the HTTP response.
- **Cache Content**: Cache static content to reduce server load and improve response times. Use a caching mechanism like Redis or in-memory caching for dynamic content.
- **Optimize Database Queries**: Analyze and optimize your database queries to minimize response time and improve overall performance.

### 3. Stability
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to ensure application stability, including logging and handling uncaught exceptions.
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability of your application. Use testing frameworks like Mocha, Jest, or Jasmine to create unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up a continuous integration (CI) system, such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins, to automatically test and build your application upon changes.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor your application to detect and resolve issues proactively. Use tools like [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for real-time monitoring and alerting.

### 4. Scalability
- **Load Balancing**: Utilize load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application, increasing its ability to handle high traffic loads.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design your application to support horizontal scaling, enabling it to handle increased traffic by adding more resources (e.g., servers) rather than increasing the capacity of existing resources.

**Please Note**: The above guidelines are intended to help you get started with your production deployment, but they may not be exhaustive. It's crucial to consult additional resources or seek expert advice to ensure your application meets all necessary requirements for your specific use case. Stay legally compliant and prioritize the safety and security of your application at all times.


## Structure

The structure should help teams understand and separte concerns. It should be boring to build on top of this structure, everyone should know where to put things.

The general idea here uses names for folders also used in the Express Docs to make it clear what sits where.

<b>`Routes -> Middlewares -> Controllers -> Services -> Database Methods -> Persistent Layer`</b>

Where <b>utils</b> is a seperate folder to host functions to be used througout the application.
