# express-ts-boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate template for building microservices and APIs with Express.js. It provides a basic structure for organizing your code and includes some common libraries and utilities that are useful for building microservices and APIs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, you can simply clone the repository and start building your own microservices/ APIs.

Using npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-boilerplate.git
cd express-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000. You can start building by modifying the code in the src directory.

## Features

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
- [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/): JavaScript Style Guide, with linter & automatic code fixer.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A popular web framework for Node.js that provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs.
- [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet): Helps secure Express apps with various HTTP headers.
- [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston): A logger for just about everything.
- [nodemon](): A development utility that automatically restarts the server when changes are made to the code.
